        <h2> It Is a Tiny Bit About Me </h2>  
    </body>
        <p> Hey howdie, I am from <strong>Indonesia.</strong> Currently i m studying <em> Computer Information Technology </em> in BCIT.
        Among my classmate i feel i am the slowest one since i start everything from the bottom at my age that is not too young. 
        In addition<strong> english</strong> is not my native language and school is delivering by <strong>online</strong>. Everything is 
        so hard and i am struggling a lot in this beginning of studying. However i will not give up!</p>
        <p>Right now i am taking several courses, some of them are;
        <ul>
            <li>Scripting for IT</li>
            <li>Fundamental Web Technology</li>
            <li>Organizational Behaviour <a href="https://learn.bcit.ca/d2l/home/714780">Website</a></li> 
        </ul> </p>
