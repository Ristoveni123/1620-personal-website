    <p> Hey howdie, I am from <strong>Indonesia.</strong> 
        Currently i m studying <em> Computer Information Technology </em> 
        in BCIT. Among my classmate i feel i am the slowest one since
        i start everything from the bottom at my age which is not too young. 
        In addition<strong> English</strong> is not my native language and 
        school is delivering by <strong>online</strong>. Everything is so
        hard and i am struggling a lot in this beginning of studying. 
        However i will not give up!</p>
